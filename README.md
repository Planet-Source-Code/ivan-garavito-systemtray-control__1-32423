### Description

This is a activex control to help you with the system tray icons handling. I've never seen another like this. It's very easy to use, and i show some great stuff!!

This is a really old project, but it´s useful! It has 5 mouse events as follows:

* click

* dblclick

* mousedown

* mousemove

* mouseup

It never was too easy!!
